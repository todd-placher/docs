To install the DisplayLink Driver open the Terminal and move to the Download directory like so: (the version for the driver may change so look at the file name and change it accordly.)

```
cd Downloads
unzip DisplayLink\ USB\ Graphics\ Software\ for\ Ubuntu\ 1.4.zip

```

For installing the NVIDIA Driver that we provide you can use this support article: [System76 NVIDIA Driver](http://support.system76.com/articles/system76-driver/).
