### Install Steam From Command Line

Open the <u>Terminal</u> application by searching for <u>Terminal</u> after pressing the Super Key <kbd><i class="fl-ubuntu"></i></kbd>.

Once the <u>Terminal</u> application is opened you can use the Command Line tool `apt` to search for it like so:

apt search steam
```

Once we find the right name for <u>Steam</u> we can install it with `apt` as well. Please type this command into the terminal and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>:

```
sudo apt install steam
```

**Be very careful when using sudo with ANY Command. It can make system wide changes so be sure to read everything before entering 'Y'.**

Once installed, use the Activities Overview to search for and run <u>Steam</u>.
