To display a dock in Pop!\_OS, you will need to install a GNOME extension.

### Installing GNOME Extensions
To get started with installing GNOME extensions, install the GNOME Tweak Tool and Chrome GNOME Shell using the following commands:
```shell
sudo apt install gnome-tweak-tool chrome-gnome-shell
```

Then open Firefox or Chromium (or Google Chrome) and install the GNOME shell integration tool if needed:
- [Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gnome-shell-integration/)
- [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gnome-shell-integration/gphhapmejobijbbhgpjhcjognlahblep?hl=en)

Once the shell integration software is done, you can move on to installing the Dash To Dock extension.

### Installing the Dash to Dock Extension
Navigate to the [Dash to Dock extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/307/dash-to-dock/). Click the slider on the right which says "OFF".

Click the "Install" button which pops up, as seen below:

You should have now installed Dash to Dock.

### Tweaking Dash to Dock Settings
To adjust settings, first refresh the installation page. You should now see a settings icon, like this:

Click that to bring up the settings panel, as seen below:

![Settings Panel]({{site.baseurl}}/images/dash-to-dock/settings-panel.png)

You can tweak settings within this panel to your liking.

### Ubuntu Like Dock
On that settings page, adjust some of the settings to make it look more like Ubuntu 17.10 if that is the theme you are going for. Here are some settings which work well:
